# BigD-in-R-Airline-Delays
The 5th case study on rdatasciencecases.org

## Data
- [All Airline Delays](http://rdatasciencecases.org/Data/Airline/AirlineDelays.tar.bz2)
- [By year/month](http://rdatasciencecases.org/Data/Airline)

## Questions
1. Using the UNIXÂ® shell, create the AirlineDataAll.csv file without using a loop.
2. Write a preprocessing script (using the shell, R, Python or any tools) to create a file that can be used with bigmemory, i.e., convert the non-numeric values to numeric values in some well-defined manner.
3. How many flights were there for each day of the week?
4. For each year, how many flights were there for each day of the week?
5. For each year, how many of the tail codes are listed as NA?
6. Which year had the greatest proportion of late flights? Is this result significant?
7. Which flight day is best for minimizing departure delays? Which time of day?
8. Which is the best day of the week to fly?
9. Which is the best day of the month to fly?
10. Are flights being given more time to reach their destination for later years?
11. Which departure and arrival airport combination is associated with the worst delays?
12. One of the examples in this section creates a vector, named planeStart, which gives the first month in which a plane with a given tail code appears in the data set. Estimate the amount of time the loop to create this vector will take to run sequentially? and in parallel?
13. How many of the planes ages are censored?
14. How much do weather delays contribute to arrival delay?
15. Along with age, which other variables in the airline delay data set contribute to arrival delays?
